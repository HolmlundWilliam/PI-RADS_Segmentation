# Prostate Segmentation according to the PI-RADS standard using a 3D-CNN

**Welcome**,
to the GitHub page of my Master Thesis Project.
This page will provide links to the Thesis report, the software *HERO* - for which the model will be implemented in the free version, as well as a link to download the trained model as a frozen graph (from TensorFlow), ready to use in Python.

The Thesis aimed to create an automatic solution for segmentation of the prostate and its internal anatomical zones from MR images, as this can be a very time-consuming task.
The result is this model with an aritechture of a 3D Convolutional Neural Network.

Later this fall, the model will be available in the free version of HERO (www.heroimaging.com) - a graphical programming platform that enables complex image analysis, in an easy and interactive way.

This will be the easiest and most straight-forward way of using the model - although some patience is needed.

The trained model is also available as a frozen graph (TensorFlow), which can be used directly in Python.
